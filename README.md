1. Overview of the Application: A deep learning-based system using PyTorch and Streamlit to predict depression risk from mental health survey data.  

2. Project Goal: To analyze demographic, lifestyle, and psychological factors to predict the likelihood of depression.  

3. Technology Stack: Uses PyTorch for model training, Streamlit for the UI, and AWS for deployment.  

4. Dataset: Mental health survey data including variables like age, gender, work stress, financial burden, and sleep patterns.  

5. Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and normalizes numerical variables.  

6. Feature Engineering: Selects relevant features impacting mental health while ensuring data consistency.  

7. Model Architecture: Implements a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with hidden layers and a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.  

8. Evaluation Metrics: Assesses accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and bias to ensure fairness in predictions.  

9. Training Pipeline: Automates the entire process from data ingestion to model training and testing.  

10. Bias Mitigation: Evaluates model performance across different demographics to prevent biased predictions.  

11. Streamlit User Interface: Provides an interactive web app where users input personal details to receive depression risk predictions.  

12. User Inputs: Includes data fields such as work status, stress levels, social activity, sleep duration, and past mental health history.  

13. Prediction Output: Displays a probability score indicating the likelihood of depression.  

14. Model Deployment: Hosted on AWS (Elastic Beanstalk/EC2) or Streamlit Cloud for real-time accessibility.  

15. Use Cases: Beneficial for healthcare professionals, mental health organizations, corporate wellness programs, and public health initiatives.  

16. Project Deliverables: Includes source code, trained model files, documentation, and a working web application.  

17. Version Control: Uses GitHub for tracking changes, ensuring collaboration and project reproducibility.  

18. Code Quality & Best Practices: Follows Python coding standards, well-commented scripts, and modular implementation.  

19. Scalability & Future Scope: The model can be improved with more data and additional deep learning techniques.  

20. Deployment Guide: Provides clear instructions to set up the environment, train the model, and run the Streamlit application.
